## About The Project

Meet.AI is not just another video calling app. It's an intelligent meeting platform designed to enhance productivity by integrating custom AI agents directly into live conversations. As a full-stack application built on a **Next.js and PostgreSQL** foundation, it covers everything from real-time communication to subscription management.

After each call, the platform provides a complete post-meeting experience with automated summaries, full transcripts, video playback, and a contextual AI chat to ask questions about the meeting content.

## Key Features

-   **ü§ñ Real-Time AI Agent (Gemini API):** Engage with a custom AI agent that can answer questions and provide information *during* the live video call.
-   **üìù Post-Call AI Analysis (OpenAI API):** Automatically generate concise summaries and full, accurate transcripts after each meeting concludes.
-   **üìû Real-Time Video & Chat:** High-quality video and chat powered by the **Stream Video & Chat SDK**.
-   **üìÇ Complete Meeting Lifecycle:** Track meetings through various states: Upcoming, Active, Processing, and Completed.
-   **üì∫ Meeting Playback & History:** Access a full history of your past meetings, including video recordings and transcripts.
-   **üîç Transcript Search:** Quickly find key moments by searching through the meeting transcript.
-   **üí¨ Contextual AI Q&A:** Chat with an AI that has the full context of a completed meeting to ask specific questions about the discussion.
-   **üîê Secure Authentication:** Robust and simple user login provided by **Better Auth**, including social providers like Google and GitHub.
-   **üí≥ Subscription Management:** Seamlessly handle payments and premium features using the **Polar SDK**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Mobile Functionality

Please be aware that the **real-time AI agent, powered by the Gemini API, is currently functional only on desktop browsers.**

This is due to inherent restrictions and configurations within the Gemini API's web integration for mobile devices. The rest of the application, including initiating video calls, using the chat, and accessing your post-meeting dashboard, is fully functional and responsive on mobile.

## Project Workflow Summary

The development of this project followed a structured, chapter-by-chapter process:

1.  **Foundation:** Initial Next.js setup, GitHub repository, and configuration of the Neon database with Drizzle ORM.
2.  **Authentication:** Integrated Better Auth for user registration, login, and social providers, along with creating the necessary UI and protected routes.
3.  **Core UI & tRPC:** Built the main dashboard layout (sidebar, navbar) and set up tRPC for typesafe client-server communication.
4.  **Feature Modules (Agents & Meetings):** Developed the core SaaS features, allowing users to create and manage custom AI Agents and schedule Meetings. This included forms, data tables with filters, and individual resource pages.
5.  **Real-Time Integration:** Integrated the Stream SDK to power the live video call experience and connected the real-time Gemini agent via webhooks.
6.  **Post-Call Experience:** Set up Inngest to handle background jobs for processing recordings, generating summaries/transcripts with OpenAI, and enabling the post-call AI chat.
7.  **Monetization:** Added the Polar SDK and Better Auth adapter to manage user subscriptions and protect premium features.
